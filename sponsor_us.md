# Sponsor Us

ClojureBridge Berlin organizes free programming workshops for members of
underrepresented groups. All organizers, teachers, and assistants volunteer a
part of their free time. To cover costs we rely on the generous patronage of
companies that support us in our cause.

## Rewards

By supporting us you help to make the world a little better. Your company also
gets to associate itself with a positive and ambitious event, which aims to
increase diversity in the technology scene.

Sponsors are listed on our website and on our event page on ClojureBridge.org.
They receive a shoutout at the start and end of the event, and receive a warm
"thank you" on our social media account. We also list sponsors by name on our
popular t-shirts that are handed out to teachers and attendees, and provide the
opportunity to offer "swag" (stickers, note books, thumb drives, etc.) at the
event.

## Financial

To handle donations we work with
[Travis Foundation UG](http://foundation.travis-ci.org/), a registered
not-for-profit company (a “Gemeinnützige Organisation” under German law.) Travis
Foundation can issue a Donation Receipt for accounting and tax deduction. It
does *not* issue invoices for donations.

As a sponsor you can also choose to directly pick up the bill for one of our
expenses, in which case we let the supplier invoice your company directly. This
can be a great way to make your contribution more concrete and visible ("thank
you Foocorp Inc. for the lovely t-shirts!"). Keep in mind that in this case we
might not be able to predict up front the exact amount invoiced, it could for
instance depend on the amount of sign-ups.
