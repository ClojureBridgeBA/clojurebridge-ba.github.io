# Coach at ClojureBridge

ClojureBridge aims to increase diversity within the Clojure community by offering free, beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshops for women. The next workshop is on Friday June 17, and Saturday June 18, 2016. On Friday evening we install the software which is needed and get o know each other. Saturday is for coding in groups, learning and talks.
