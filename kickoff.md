title: ClojureBridge Third Edition, Kickoff Meeting
permalink: /kickoff/
---

Coming summer we will hold our third ClojureBridge Berlin workshop. Organizing a workshop is a lot of work, and so we want to kick things off early and spread the work out over the coming months.

We want to invite everyone who wants to play a part in organizing this workshop to come to Wunderlist coming Tuesday, 29 March 2016 at 19:00. In particular we invite past attendees and coaches who want to pay it forward and play a more active role in ClojureBridge.

We will have a presentation about what goes into organizing, the tasks, timeframe, and way of working. You won't have to commit to anything yet, you are welcome to come and listen, and then decide afterwards what role you see for yourself. There will be both bigger and smaller roles, so it's up to you what kind of time commitment you are able to make.

Besides that we will finalize the date of the workshop and other key dates

- date of the workshop, installfest, coaches training
- opening and closing of applications
- deadline for sponsor applications
- frequency and days of core team meetings
- date of retrospective meeting
